## Error Handling

All errors return a consistent JSON response:

```json
{
  "message": "Error description here"
}
```

| Status Code | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 400 | Bad request / validation error |
| 401 | Unauthorized / invalid credentials |
| 404 | Resource not found |
| 409 | Conflict (e.g. email already exists) |
| 500 | Internal server error |

---

## JWT Token

After login or register, you receive a JWT token. Use it in all protected requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...
```

Token contains:
- `uid` — user ID
- `name` — user name
- `email` — user email
- `role` — User / Admin
- `exp` — expiry timestamp

---
## Category Module

Built a full CRUD Category API with clean layered architecture.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/category` | Get all categories | No |
| GET | `/api/category/{id}` | Get category by ID | No |
| POST | `/api/category` | Create category | Admin only |
| PUT | `/api/category/{id}` | Update category | Admin only |
| DELETE | `/api/category/{id}` | Delete category | Admin only |

### Tech Decisions
- Only Admin can create, update, delete categories
- Public GET endpoints — no auth required
- Soft delete via `IsActive` flag supported
## Product Module

Built a full CRUD Product API with Admin-only write access.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/product` | Get all products | No |
| GET | `/api/product/{id}` | Get product by ID | No |
| POST | `/api/product` | Create product | Admin only |
| PUT | `/api/product/{id}` | Update product | Admin only |
| DELETE | `/api/product/{id}` | Delete product | Admin only |

### Tech Decisions
- Admin ID automatically extracted from JWT token on create
- Product response includes Category name via Include/Join
- Stock and IsActive managed separately
## Review Module

Users can post, update, and delete reviews on products.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/review/{productId}` | Get all reviews for a product | No |
| POST | `/api/review` | Add a review | User |
| PUT | `/api/review/{id}` | Update your review | User |
| DELETE | `/api/review/{id}` | Delete your review | User |

### Tech Decisions
- One review per user per product (duplicate check enforced)
- Only owner can update or delete their review
- Product AverageRating and ReviewCount auto-updated on review create
- User loaded via EF Core Include for response

## Cart Module

Users can manage their shopping cart with full CRUD operations.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/cart` | Get user's cart | User |
| POST | `/api/cart/add` | Add item to cart | User |
| PUT | `/api/cart/update` | Update item quantity | User |
| DELETE | `/api/cart/remove/{productId}` | Remove item from cart | User |
| DELETE | `/api/cart/clear` | Clear entire cart | User |

### Tech Decisions
- Every user gets their own cart auto-created on first add
- Grand total and per-item total calculated in service layer
- Duplicate product check — quantity increases if already in cart


## Order Module

Users can place orders directly from their cart with COD or Online payment support.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| POST | `/api/order/checkout` | Place order from cart | User |
| GET | `/api/order/my-orders` | Get all my orders | User |
| GET | `/api/order/{id}` | Get order detail | User |
| PATCH | `/api/order/{id}/status` | Update order status | Admin only |

### Tech Decisions
- Order items and price snapshot taken from Cart at checkout time — price manipulation not possible from frontend
- Cart auto-cleared after successful order
- Payment record created automatically on checkout
- COD and Online payment methods supported
- Only Admin can update order status

## Cloudinary Image Upload

All images (Products and Categories) are uploaded to Cloudinary via the backend. Frontend never directly communicates with Cloudinary — API keys stay secure on the server.

### How it works
1. Admin sends image as `multipart/form-data` to the API
2. Backend uploads image to Cloudinary
3. Cloudinary returns a secure URL
4. URL is saved in the database

### Image Optimization
All uploaded images are automatically:
- Resized to max 800x800
- Quality optimized (`auto`)
- Format optimized (`auto` — WebP where supported)

### Folder Structure on Cloudinary
### Endpoints that accept images

| Method | Endpoint | Field Name |
|--------|----------|------------|
| POST | `/api/product` | `Image` |
| PUT | `/api/product/{id}` | `Image` |
| POST | `/api/category` | `Image` |
| PUT | `/api/category/{id}` | `Image` |

> All image endpoints use `multipart/form-data`, not `application/json`.


## User Profile Module / new change in user module-- read thiss

Users can update their profile including phone number, date of birth, and profile picture.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/user/profile` | Get profile | User |
| PUT | `/api/user/profile` | Update profile with image | User |
| PATCH | `/api/user/change-password` | Change password | User |
| DELETE | `/api/user/delete` | Delete account | User |

### Tech Decisions
- Profile image uploaded to Cloudinary — URL saved in Users table
- Phone stored but verified at checkout time
- IsPhoneVerified flag for future OTP implementation

---

## Address Module

Users can manage multiple saved addresses with default address support.

### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| GET | `/api/address` | Get all my addresses | User |
| POST | `/api/address` | Add new address | User |
| PUT | `/api/address/{id}` | Update address | User |
| DELETE | `/api/address/{id}` | Delete address | User |
| PATCH | `/api/address/{id}/default` | Set default address | User |

### Tech Decisions
- Multiple addresses per user supported
- First address automatically set as default
- Default address shown first in list
- Only owner can modify their addresses

## Payment Module (Razorpay)

Secure payment integration using Razorpay. Payment amount is always taken from the database — never from frontend, preventing price manipulation.

### Flow
### Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description | Auth Required |
|--------|----------|-------------|---------------|
| POST | `/api/payment/initiate/{orderId}` | Create Razorpay order | User |
| POST | `/api/payment/verify` | Verify payment signature | User |

### Tech Decisions
- Amount fetched from DB — frontend cannot manipulate price
- HMAC SHA256 signature verification — industry standard
- Payment record auto-updated on success
- COD orders blocked from payment initiation
- Already paid orders blocked from re-initiation

### Testing in Postman (without frontend)

**Step 1 — Register/Login**
```json
POST /api/auth/login
{
  "email": "admin@shopnext.com",
  "password": "Admin@123"
}
```
Copy the JWT token from response.

**Step 2 — Add to Cart**
```json
POST /api/cart/add
Authorization: Bearer <token>
{
  "productId": 1,
  "quantity": 2
}
```

**Step 3 — Place Order**
```json
POST /api/order/checkout
Authorization: Bearer <token>
{
  "shippingAddress": "123 Delhi, India",
  "paymentMethod": "Online"
}
```
Note the `id` from response.

**Step 4 — Initiate Payment**

Note the `razorpayOrderId` from response.

**Step 5 — Verify Payment**
```json
POST /api/payment/verify
Authorization: Bearer <token>
{
  "orderId": 4,
  "razorpayOrderId": "order_xxx",
  "razorpayPaymentId": "pay_xxx",
  "razorpaySignature": "invalid_for_test"
}
```
Expected: `"Invalid payment signature"` — correct behavior without real frontend.
